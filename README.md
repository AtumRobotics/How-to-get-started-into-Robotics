# How-to-get-started-into-Robotics
Use this repo as a road map for anyone who is starting his career into robotics. We have refereed and added the best in class resources into the repo.
This repos was maintaned and crafted by Atum Robotics.


WHY ROBOTICS ?
Industry 4.0 has boosted this industry majorly. So carrers and opportunites related to Robotics was expected to grow 10x globally. Most importantly isnt fun to make a machine or piece of metal think and move autonomously ??.


##HOW TO GET STARTED ?



### STEP 1 : Make Your first baby step?

  The best way to get started is to learn simple Arduino based interfaces, Start basic interfaces such as Ultrasonic, IR or Motor drivers. This basic     Arduino Interfacing helps you to be proficent with controlers and gives you an basic idea into Robotics.

  ### Some of the useful resources :

  a) To learn about Sensor and display - https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/unexpectedmaker/ultrasoniceyes-b9fd38?ref=tag&ref_id=ultrasonic&offset=1
  
  b) To learn about Actuators - https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/tartrobotics/quadruped-robot-30f8d9?ref=tag&ref_id=ultrasonic&offset=34
  
  c) To learn about mobility - https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/xavier-tan/ground-based-obstacle-avoiding-robot-456e33?ref=tag&ref_id=ultrasonic&offset=35

### SOME OF THE SIMULATION RESOURCES :

1) TINKERCAD - https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits
2) WEBOTS - https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installing-webots

By end of this first phase, you will gain the following skillsets Controller interfacing, Basics of sensor, Arduino programming, Problem solving, Design thinking etc..,



### Step 2 : Get ready for the ignition :


  Now you are on the most intresting part and its time to move from controllers to processors like jetson nano or raspberry pi.

   ### Some of the useful resources :

   a) https://nevonprojects.com/raspberry-pi-based-android-controlled-surveillance-robot/
   
   b) https://www.pantechsolutions.net/real-time-object-recognition-using-raspberry-pi-with-neural-compute-stick-2
   
   c) To learn python, my all time favourite - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw 

  ### SOME OF THE SIMULATION RESOURCES 
    
    1) WEBOTS - https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installing-webots
    
    By end of this second phase, you will gain the following skillsets Processor - Controller interface, Advance sensors like camera, Intro into AI, Python etc..,



### Step 3 : The real game starts.


 Now you are familar with controller and processor and also you know python and c++ for an extent. Now its time to apply them all and do some magic.
And this would be a right time to get into advance robotics systems like " ROS " .

### Some of the useful resources :

1) To learn ROS - https://robocademy.com/2020/04/28/top-free-tutorials-to-learn-ros-robot-operating-system/

2) TO get started into Autonomous mobile robots - https://articulatedrobotics.xyz/mobile-robot-1-project-overview/

3) To get started into Robotics manipulators - https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-set-up-and-control-a-robotic-arm-using-moveit-and-ros/

or

  ### SOME OF THE SIMULATION RESOURCEs
    
    1) Gazebo - https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials
    
  Now you are familar with ROS,Moveit, Gazebo, SLAM and so on. From here you would have a clear idea of proceeding further. From here choose your own path and contine your jounrey of never ending learnig.

From here try to understand the backened process of each and every packages you used and try to understand there mathmatics.

All the best for your journey.
